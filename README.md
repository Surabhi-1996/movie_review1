# Movie Review using Text Classification Method

## In this project we'll try to develop a classification model - that is, we'll try to predict the Positive/Negative labels based on text content alone for movie review dataset.


- The dataset contains the text of 2000 movie reviews. 1000 are positive, 1000 are negative, and the text.
- Data cleaning to remove missing values and empty strings.
- Build pipelines to vectorize the data, then train and fit a model
- Feed the training data through the pipeline of below models
  - Naive Bayes
  - Linear SVC
-Run predictions and analyze the results
